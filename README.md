# FoodTruck

Food Truck Application/ High Level Design 

1. Application fetches the data from the given API without using API tokens
2. App fetches the data once from API source in the background while opening the app
3. A “Loading data from API” progress dialog is shown while fetching the data from API
4. Caching can be used instead of fetching details from API every time when App is opened. This is useful when the number of users of the app increase.
